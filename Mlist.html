    There are thousands of movies there to watch, but let's be realistic not
    all of them make the cut. Either the storyline is boring, to long, the starring actors
    just can't act no offence to Leonardo DiCaprio, or its just
    not what you were looking for. Well luckily you have a friend like myself who has watched
    a vast amount of movies. Lets start this movie list right and start of with some of the best
    action movies, can't just jump to my favorite horror movies, and scare everyone away now can we?

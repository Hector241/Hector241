      The Css box model is 4 boxes within each other with all of them
      having different functions. Content is the box that holds the text
      and images. Padding is the space between the content and the
      border which is transparent, the border is self explanatory. Margin
      is the outside spade of the border which is also transparent.

      The most important part of css is positioning. There are 6 different
      types that you can choose from static, relative, fixed, absolute,
      initial, and inherit. Static goes with the flow of the page and is
      not affected by any attributes. Relative position would go where it
      normaly would and you can add attributes to it such as left/right etc.
      Fixed position will stay on the same spot on the page no matter what.
      Absolute position will be placed closests to the previous positioning.

    <p>The article tag is for repeatable/reuseable tags for blogs, forums, posts etc or a movie list.
    Also a ".div name attribute" will target and only affect those attribute inside the div.
    The navigation bar can be made as a list(ul-unordered list li-list item) or as a
    table(tr-table row th-table headings).
